#URL --> Uniform resource locator
an address of a unique resource on the internet
Components of URL
http://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument

http://                     --> this is the protocol. HTTP can be replaced by HTTPS
www.example.com             --> this is the domain. under the hood, this points to the IP address of the server where the call is being directed
:80                         --> port of the server where the data resides
/path/to/myfile.html        --> path to the location of the document within the webserver
?key1=value1&key2=value2    --> the parameter being passed to the web sever. sometimes the API using the URL may need these parameters to process
                                the data before returning the response to the user.
#SomewhereInTheDocument     --> this is an anchor point, on the document. Think of an anchor as a bookmark. this will tell the URL to pull
                                up the specific point in the document for the user

API --> Application programming interface, allows 2 systems to communicate. Each API has documentation on how each component talks to each other
API are categorized in to SOAP and REST based API. Both of them are used to communicate with the web.
SOAP --> these API communicate by means of an xml
REST --> these API communicate by means of URL. URLs are used to receive and send information.
The following 4 HTTP 1.1 verbs are used to perform actions --> GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
the response of a REST based web service is in the form of a JSON/CSV/RSS etc.

END POINTS --> the area where the REST API send requests and receive response from are called end points. Since end points are the location of
                the resources that the APIs seek, it is important that end points are always kept available.

API KEYS   --> codes that are passed using the URL to gain access to contents on the web server. This is a security measure used to ensure that
                only authorized folks get access to the content
